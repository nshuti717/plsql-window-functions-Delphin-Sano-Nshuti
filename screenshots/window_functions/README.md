For Ranking Functions Screenshot:
"This query demonstrates the use of RANK() to identify the top 5 revenue-generating products for each month. The ranking helps prioritize inventory management by highlighting which products contribute most to monthly revenue. Products with the same revenue receive the same rank, with gaps in ranking numbers after ties."
For Running Totals Screenshot:
"The running total calculation shows cumulative sales progression throughout the period. This analysis helps track daily cash flow and identify when the business reaches specific revenue milestones. The monthly running total resets at the beginning of each month, providing insight into month-to-date performance."
For Month-over-Month Growth Screenshot:
"This analysis uses LAG() to compare current month sales with the previous month, calculating growth percentages. The results show business momentum and help identify seasonal patterns. Positive growth percentages indicate business expansion, while negative values signal areas requiring attention."
For Customer Segmentation Screenshot:
"Using NTILE(4), customers are divided into four equal groups based on their total spending. Premium customers (Quartile 1) represent the highest value segment and should receive priority attention through personalized services and loyalty programs. This segmentation enables targeted marketing strategies for each customer group."
